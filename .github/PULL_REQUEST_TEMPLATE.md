<!--

Thank you very much for contributing to imag.

Please notice: I, the author of imag, am currently on a sabatical (May 2018
until early 2019). I am not sure whether I will have access to the internet
during that time. I may respond slowly - delay of 2-4 weeks or even more are
possible! I hope it won't be more.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

We will close issue and PR contributions via github at some time in the future
(more information [here](https://imag-pim.org/blog/2018/06/10/off-of-github/))!
